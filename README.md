k-Nearest Neighbors
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a type of supervised learning algorithm which is used for both regression and classification purposes, but mostly it is used for the later. Given a dataset with different classes, KNN tries to predict the correct class of test data by calculating the distance between the test data and all the training points. It then selects the k points which are closest to the test data. Once the points are selected, the algorithm calculates the probability (in case of classification) of the test point belonging to the classes of the k training points and the class with the highest probability is selected. In the case of a regression problem, the predicted value is the mean of the k selected training points.
